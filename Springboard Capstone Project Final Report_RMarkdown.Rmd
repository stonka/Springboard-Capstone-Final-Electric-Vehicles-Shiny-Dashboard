~~~ Springboard Capstone Project: Final Report ~~~



I. THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Provide a user friendly summary dashboard along with relevant filtered data for global 'electric vehicles charging stations'
   based on the data from www.OpenChargeMap.org. 
   
2. Explore any insightful visualizations for the OpenChargeMap data set in RShiny.



II. THE CLIENT, WHY BOTHER, & OPPORTUNITIES 

1. The OpenChargeMap team
   - may choose to adopt the format, visualization options, or selected content to alter how it communicates and lets the site user
   to interpret its data.
   
2. An electric vehicle user
   - may choose to use the dashboard to look up local charging stations data or learn about the global station network, condition to
   (or not) relevant data entry validation or timeframe status. 
   
3. A researcher, student, or any user
   - may choose to learn more about the local or global network of the electric vehicles charging stations network by accessing the
   auto-scaled visuals, complete data set, data source web site.  He/she may choose to improve this dashboard look, content etc. to
   make it more effective for any end user.


   
- OPPORTUNITIES -- Data collection:
  1. Improve on updateding the station validation status.  THere are about 72k entries in this dataset. Only about 2% of that are
     stations marked as validated.  The data user client may benefit from knowing if a station not marked as 'recently validated' 
     is a station that is indeed open.
  2. Correct the 'country ID' coding.  The expectation is that the 'country IDs' match the ISO country codes.  This is not true. 
     Correcting that may provide data user a more reliable view of the data set.

- OPPORTUNITIES -- Statistical analysis:
  1. Including a population census data, proximity of stations to the highway systems, electric vehicle sales data, or alternative
     vehicle 'charging' stations (like natural gas or gasoline) may bring additional insights to the visualizations and a more
     in-depth statstical [predictive) modeling.  
     It would be interesting to construct a kind of supervised model to explore and interpret meaningful dependencies among the
     variables.

- OPPORTUNITIES -- RShiny Dashboard:
  1. A more appealing and interactive world map 
  2. Alter data set to display country names, or include slicer-like widget to allow the user to filetr for set of counries.  A
     corrected 'country ID' and 'country name' is now available.



III. APPROACH

1. DATA SET
- I decided to use data set for the electric vehicles charging stations as published by the OpenChargeMap.com
- I accessed the data directly through the OpenChargeMap API.  The analysis and Shiny dashboard is based on the real time accessed
  data.  THe API link is: https://api.openchargemap.io/v2/poi/?output=json&maxresults=130000&compact=true&verbose=false 

2. DATA WRANGLING
- I reviewed the data, and decided what variables may be useful to keep for my project*.
- I mutated the names of the columns as needed.  For example, raw data 'AddressInfo' field consisted of 16 sub-columns.  
  I altereded that to be able to call out country IDs, station lat/long data, and others in the exploratory analysis and 
  dashboard itself.
- I handled N/A values as needed, replaced them with "0" values, and excluded them from the analysis and visuals as needed.
- I did other trivial data wrangling (i.e. variable value replacement for 'UsageTypeID') as needed.

3. DATA VISUALIZATION & STORYTELLING
- I made sure that some of the summary dashboard boxes display expected summary data formattin (i.e comma in thousnads, %).
- I wire-framed the Shiny App look for the data, as I visualized it.  I made a 'prototype' in MS PowerBI. 
- I learned how to use RShiny App to display the summary Dashboard for the complete data set and its subset.  
- I took an effective guidance from my mentor about the reactive features of Shiny App and the interactive mapping set-up.



IV. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
I concluded that:
- There are, generally speaking, weak realtionships among most of the remaing 21 variables in my final raw data
- Due to the nature of the data, an interactive data visualization approach may be most effective data exploration tool and a great
  learning opportunity for me
- Interesting insights from this data set come from: timeseries, statistic summary, mapping/plotting  
- RShiny App is the best environment for an interactive visualization of this data set
